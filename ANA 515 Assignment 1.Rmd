We have data about `r nrow(my_data)` individuals killed by guns. Only `r nrow(my_data) - nrow(youth)`  are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below: 

# Gun deaths by age 
```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE} 
library(ggplot2)
youth %>% 
ggplot(aes(age)) + 
geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```

# Gun deaths by race 
```{r race-dist, echo = FALSE} 
youth %>% 
ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race)%>%fct_rev())) + 
geom_bar() + coord_flip() + 
labs(x = "Victim race") 
```
